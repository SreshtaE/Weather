About
This project is a web-based Event Registration Management Application designed to streamline the 
registration process for college events. It enables users to easily view available events, register 
with a single click, and manage their registrations. Event organizers benefit from a simplified 
event management dashboard that provides real-time insights into attendee lists and event capacities. 
This application was developed as part of a collaborative college project, with a focus on creating 
a responsive, scalable, and efficient solution using modern web technologies and cloud-based 
infrastructure.
